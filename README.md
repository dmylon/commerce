### Project Description

"Bid It" is an eBay-like e-commerce auction website that allows users to post auction listings, place bids on listings, comment on those listings, and add listings to a â€œwatchlist". This project was developed back in December 2020 as a small personal project made for fun and exercise with basic full stack web development technologies, with no intention of being used in production or for any commercial use. The current version of the website is designed to be desktop-only. 
The website allows the user to view active listings without having an account, while the other services provided require the user to be signed in.

The signed in user could also add some of the active listings on a personal watchlist, in order to keep track of the auction procedure more easily. In addition, for easier navigation, the user is able to browse listings based on their category(four basic categories are included in the current version).

If the user is interested about a product, they are able to view some details provided by the owner, as well as place a bid in order to compete against other interested users.

 Also, the user is able to post a comment about the product, or review the already existing comments made by other users.

Finally the user is able to create their own listings and control the auction's closing time. When an auction is closed, the winner is notified when visiting the product's page.
