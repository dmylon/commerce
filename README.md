### Project Description

"Bid It" is an eBay-like e-commerce auction website that allows users to post auction listings, place bids on listings, comment on those listings, and add listings to a â€œwatchlist". This project was developed back in December 2020 as a small personal project made for fun and exercise with basic full stack web development technologies, with no intention of being used in production or for any commercial use. The current version of the website is designed to be desktop-only. 
The website allows the user to view active listings without having an account, while the other services provided require the user to be signed in.
